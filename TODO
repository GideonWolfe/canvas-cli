TODO:
  Submit local files to an assignment

  Usability of list assignments (typing the long course ID isn't ideal)

  Messaging (maybe this needs to wait for the TUI...)

  Canvas-cli should be usable for professors and TA's too, so ability for profs to change grades/post assignments?

  Account settings

  Get and view unread announcements

  Download files that are in course -> files -> /directory/to/file
